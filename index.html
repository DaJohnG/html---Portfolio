    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I am a Graphic Designer and Photographer, as well as a recent graduate
      from Bloomfield College. I've obtained a Bachelor of Arts while Majoring
      in Graphic Design with a Minor in Expanded Media. I have alot of
      experience using the Adobe Softwares from Photoshop to After Effects, as
      well as some beginner knowledge in programs like Dreamweaver, Blender,
      Tinkercad, and HTML and Java web languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as experience, I’ve created advertisements for plays and different
      productions at my college including posters, flyers and banners. I was
      responsible for page designs in my high school year book and I’ve also
      worked in a small print shop creating stationary for Essex County
      Vocational Technical Schools. My last bit of experience was interning for
      Filmmaker David Gaynes as a concept artist.
